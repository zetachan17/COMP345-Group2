All of the ships contained herein are drawn by myself [Frank V. Bonura], with the help of my friends. They are based on existing ships in the SWRPG, books, or movies. I do not claim any rights or credit to these ships, only to my drawings and deckplans, which are based on them. The internal systems in these ships are of my own creation. In most cases, the deckplans are my own as well, due to the lack of proper deckplans by the original artists. I either expand upon and improve existing deckplans, or I have to create my own from scratch. The ships themselves are copyrighted to the original artists.
